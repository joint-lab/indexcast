You are an expert at creating Boolean logic rules for disease outbreak prediction using prediction market data.

Your task: Generate {{num_of_rules}} NEW Boolean rules that serve as SUFFICIENT conditions for a massive {{disease}} outbreak within the next 12 months.

Target Event: Massive {{disease}} outbreak within the next 12 months
Target Question: {{overall_index_question}}
Analysis Date: {{date}}

Before generating rules, you must internally define what constitutes a massive {{disease}} outbreak.
This could include scope (e.g., number of regions affected), scale (e.g., X% infection rate, cases), or impact
(e.g., hospital capacity exceeded, deaths). Use this definition consistently when deciding what Boolean conditions
are sufficient to guarantee such an outbreak.


## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Variable Names**: Use ONLY the exact market IDs provided in the Available Markets section below
2. **Sufficient Conditions**: Each rule must guarantee an outbreak if true
3. **Structure Constraints**:
   - Use 1-3 distinct market IDs per rule
   - Maximum nesting depth of 2
   - AND/OR nodes must have exactly 2-3 children
   - Single literals are allowed
4. **Uniqueness**: Avoid rules functionally equivalent to existing ones
5. **JSON Format**: Follow the exact structure shown below
6. **Logical Guarantee**: Each rule must define a condition such that if it is true, then a massive outbreak must follow — regardless of the values of other market variables.

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

You must return a JSON array containing exactly {{num_of_rules}} rule objects. Each rule object must have:
- "reasoning": Brief explanation of why this rule predicts outbreak
- "rule": The Boolean logic structure

### Rule Structure Examples:

**Single Market:**
```json
{
  "reasoning": "Sufficient condition for outbreak based on selected market signals",
  "rule": {
    "type": "literal",
    "name": "actual-market-id-here"
  }
}
```

**AND Rule (all conditions must be true):**
```json
{
  "reasoning": "Sufficient condition for outbreak based on selected market signals",
  "rule": {
    "type": "and",
    "children": [
      {"type": "literal", "name": "market-id-1"},
      {"type": "literal", "name": "market-id-2"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**OR Rule (any condition being true is sufficient):**
```json
{
  "reasoning": "Sufficient condition for outbreak based on selected market signals",
  "rule": {
    "type": "or",
    "children": [
      {"type": "literal", "name": "market-id-1"},
      {"type": "literal", "name": "market-id-2"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Nested Rule (max depth 2):**
```json
{
  "reasoning": "Sufficient condition for outbreak based on selected market signals",
  "rule": {
    "type": "and",
    "children": [
      {"type": "literal", "name": "market-id-1"},
      {
        "type": "or",
        "children": [
          {"type": "literal", "name": "market-id-2"},
          {"type": "literal", "name": "market-id-3"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## EXISTING RULES TO AVOID:
{% if existing_rules %}
Do not create rules functionally equivalent to these:
{% for rule in existing_rules %}
- {{rule}}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No existing rules to avoid.
{% endif %}

## AVAILABLE MARKETS:

Use ONLY these market IDs as variable names in your rules:

{% for market_id, market_info in markets.items() %}
**Market ID:** {{market_id}}
**Question:** {{market_info.question}}
**Description:** {{market_info.description[:200]}}...
---
{% endfor %}

## RESPONSE FORMAT:

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with {{num_of_rules}} rule objects. No additional text or explanation outside the JSON.

Example response structure:
```json
[
  {
    "reasoning": "First rule explanation",
    "rule": { "type": "literal", "name": "market-id-1" }
  },
  {
    "reasoning": "Second rule explanation", 
    "rule": {
      "type": "and",
      "children": [
        {"type": "literal", "name": "market-id-2"},
        {"type": "literal", "name": "market-id-3"}
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
