You are an expert at constructing Boolean logic rules to identify sufficient conditions for a target event, using prediction market data.

Your task: Generate {{num_of_rules}} Boolean rules that represent SUFFICIENT conditions for the target event described in "{{overall_index_question}}" within the next 12 months.

Target Event: The event described by "{{overall_index_question}}" within the next 12 months
Analysis Date: {{date}}

Before generating rules, internally define what would constitute the occurrence of this target event.
This could include scope (e.g., number of regions affected), scale (e.g., measurable magnitude of change), or impact (e.g., economic, environmental, or social significance).
Use this internal definition consistently when determining which Boolean conditions are sufficient to indicate that the target event would occur.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Variable Names**: Use ONLY the exact market IDs provided in the Available Markets section below
2. **Sufficient Conditions**: Each rule must represent a condition that is logically sufficient for the target event to occur if true.
3. **Structure Constraints**:
   - Use 1-3 distinct market IDs per rule
   - Maximum nesting depth of 2
   - AND/OR nodes must have exactly 2-3 children
   - Single literals are allowed
4. **Uniqueness**: Avoid rules functionally equivalent to existing ones
5. **Logical Guarantee**: Each rule must define a condition such that if it is true, then the target event described by "{{overall_index_question}}" would logically follow — independent of other variables.

## AVAILABLE MARKETS:

Use ONLY these market IDs as variable names in your rules:

{% for market_id, market_info in markets.items() %}
**Market ID:** {{market_id}}
**Question:** {{market_info.question}}
**Description:** {{market_info.description[:200]}}...
---
{% endfor %}

Return JSON only—no prose—matching **exactly**:
{
  "reasoning": "...",
  "verbalization": "...",
  "rule": {
    "node_type": "...",
    "arguments": [ ... ]
  }
}

Allowed node structures inside the "rule" field:
- Variables:
  {"node_type": "variable", "var": "market-id"}
- NOT:
  {"node_type": "not", "arguments": [ <one rule> ]}
- AND / OR:
  {"node_type": "and" | "or", "arguments": [ <2 or 3 rules> ]}

Use only these node types and structure. Each rule must follow the Boolean constraints and use only the provided market IDs.
