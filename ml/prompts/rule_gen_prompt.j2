You are an expert at creating Boolean logic rules for disease outbreak prediction using prediction market data.

Your task: Generate {{num_of_rules}} Boolean rules that serve as SUFFICIENT conditions for a massive {{disease}} outbreak within the next 12 months.

Target Event: Massive {{disease}} outbreak within the next 12 months
Target Question: {{overall_index_question}}
Analysis Date: {{date}}

Before generating rules, you must internally define what constitutes a massive {{disease}} outbreak.
This could include scope (e.g., number of regions affected), scale (e.g., X% infection rate, cases), or impact
(e.g., hospital capacity exceeded, deaths). Use this definition consistently when deciding what Boolean conditions
are sufficient to guarantee such an outbreak.


## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Variable Names**: Use ONLY the exact market IDs provided in the Available Markets section below
2. **Sufficient Conditions**: Each rule must guarantee an outbreak if true
3. **Structure Constraints**:
   - Use 1-3 distinct market IDs per rule
   - Maximum nesting depth of 2
   - AND/OR nodes must have exactly 2-3 children
   - Single literals are allowed
4. **Uniqueness**: Avoid rules functionally equivalent to existing ones
5. **Logical Guarantee**: Each rule must define a condition such that if it is true, then a massive outbreak must follow — regardless of the values of other market variables.

## AVAILABLE MARKETS:

Use ONLY these market IDs as variable names in your rules:

{% for market_id, market_info in markets.items() %}
**Market ID:** {{market_id}}
**Question:** {{market_info.question}}
**Description:** {{market_info.description[:200]}}...
---
{% endfor %}

Return JSON only—no prose—matching **exactly**:
{
  "reasoning": "...",
  "verbalization": "...",
  "rule": {
    "node_type": "...",
    "arguments": [ ... ]
  }
}

Allowed node structures inside the "rule" field:
- Variables:
  {"node_type": "variable", "var": "market-id"}
- NOT:
  {"node_type": "not", "arguments": [ <one rule> ]}
- AND / OR:
  {"node_type": "and" | "or", "arguments": [ <2 or 3 rules> ]}

Use only these node types and structure. Each rule must follow the Boolean constraints and use only the provided market IDs.
