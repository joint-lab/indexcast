Your task is to write {{num_of_rules}} NEW monotone Boolean rules that each serve as a SUFFICIENT condition for a massive {{disease}} outbreak within the next 12 months.
If a rule evaluates to true, then a massive {{disease}} outbreak will occur in the next 12 months.

Target Event: massive {{disease}} outbreak within the next 12 months
Target Question: {{overall_index_question}}
Analysis Date: {{date}}

Guidelines:
- DO NOT REPEAT RULES
- Each rule must be a SUFFICIENT condition for an outbreak in the next 12 months. A true rule guarantees the event.
- Use only positive variables (X₁, X₂, etc.) with AND and OR operators.
- Rules should use 1 to 3 distinct variables.
- A single literal (e.g., X₁) may be used alone if it alone is a sufficient predictor of an outbreak in 12 months.
- If using AND or OR, each must connect at least two literals.
- Do not use AND(X₁) or OR(X₁)—use X₁ by itself instead.
- Do not use empty OR or AND clauses. Every OR/AND must include 2 to 3 distinct literals.
- All variables must refer to indicators or market signals projected within the next 12 months.

Instructions:
1. Review previously created rules and their variables.
2. Analyze the available markets and pick 1–3 new variables predictive of a {{disease}} outbreak in the next 12 months.
3. Write a new Boolean rule (never before used) that, if true, guarantees a massive {{disease}} outbreak within the next 12 months.
4. Convert the rule to the required JSON structure.

Output Format:
Return each rule as one of the following JSON objects:

Single literal:
{
    "rule": {
        "type": "literal",
        "name": "X1"
    }
}

Compound AND:
{
    "rule": {
        "type": "and",
        "children": [
            {"type": "literal", "name": "X1"},
            {"type": "literal", "name": "X2"}
        ]
    }
}

Compound OR:
{
    "rule": {
        "type": "or",
        "children": [
            {"type": "literal", "name": "X1"},
            {"type": "literal", "name": "X2"}
        ]
    }
}

Nested (max depth 2):
{
  "rule": {
    "type": "and",
    "children": [
      { "type": "literal", "name": "X1" },
      {
        "type": "or",
        "children": [
          { "type": "literal", "name": "X2" },
          { "type": "literal", "name": "X3" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

Remember:
- Maximum 3 unique variables total
- Maximum nesting depth of 2
- Each AND/OR must have 2–3 children
- Use variable names exactly as provided in the dictionary
- You’re rewarded for shape-creative rules

You must avoid generating rules functionally equivalent to any in {{created_rules}}.  Check all prior rules for structural or variable-set duplication.
