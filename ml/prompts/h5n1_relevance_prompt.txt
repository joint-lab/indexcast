Your task is to analyze market descriptions and determine how relevant they are to the question:

For each market description, you should:
1. Carefully analyze the market's focus
2. Consider how directly it relates to the possibility of a massive H5N1 outbreak

4. Provide a relevance score between 0 and 1, where:
   - 1.0 means the market is directly and perfectly relevant to the question
   - 0.0 means the market is completely irrelevant to the question
   - Scores in between reflect partial relevance

Please provide your analysis in the following structured format:

    Consider the market's scope, timeframe, and how its resolution would inform the main question.",
    "relevance_score": <float between 0 and 1>
