    "DSPy optimizers, such as BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch and ChainOfThought, work by programmatically tuning prompts and, optionally, LM weights to maximize a user-defined metric. The process involves running a DSPy program on a set of training examples, generating and selecting few-shot demonstrations, and refining instructions or prompt content through iterative search and evaluation. For example, BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch repeatedly samples and evaluates different sets of few-shot examples, selecting the best-performing configuration, while ChainOfThought structures the reasoning process for each example.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods automate much of the manual prompt engineering process by leveraging given data and metric to systematically improve the program's performance. The optimizer compiles the high-level program into an optimized prompt or set of instructions, which is then used consistently for inference on new inputs."
