- **dspy**  
  This repository demonstrates how to use DSPy to automatically optimize prompt-based reasoning for a structured classification and scoring task. Specifically, the notebook shows how to generate a relevance score, rationale, and binary label that evaluate how well a given prediction market question predicts or relates to a broader index question.
  
  The project uses DSPy’s BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch optimizer and Chain-of-Thought reasoning to automate prompt selection and improve performance using a small, curated dataset.

- **copulas**  
  Notebook coming soon before thesis defense in late Feb. 2026 to summarize research done with copulas and prediction markets

- **eligibility**
